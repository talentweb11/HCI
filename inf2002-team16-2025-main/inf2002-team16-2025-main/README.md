## Running the app locally

This project is a static web app located in the `FireSafetyApp` folder. To view it locally you can start a simple HTTP server from the repository root and open the app in your browser.

From PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
# Open a new terminal in the /inf2002-team16-2025 folder
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open one of these URLs in your browser:

- Splash page: http://localhost:8000/FireSafetyApp/splash.html

Notes:
- The `python -m http.server` command requires Python 3. If you don't have Python installed you can use a Node-based static server (for example `npx http-server`) or another static server of your choice.
- Make sure to run the command from the repository root so paths such as `FireSafetyApp/static/...` resolve correctly.
